## System[br]
##
## The base class for all systems within the ECS framework.[br]
##
## Systems contain the core logic and behavior, processing [Entity]s that have specific [Component]s.[br]
## Each system overrides the [method System.query] and returns a query using the [QueryBuilder][br]
## exposed as [member System.q] required for it to process an [Entity] and implements the [method System.process] method.[br][br]
## [b]Example:[/b]

##     func query():
##         return q.with_all([Transform, Velocity])

##     func process(entity: Entity, delta: float) -> void:
##         var transform = entity.get_component(Transform)
##         var velocity = entity.get_component(Velocity)
##         transform.position += velocity.direction * velocity.speed * delta
